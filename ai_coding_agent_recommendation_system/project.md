# AI Coding Agent Recommendation System

## 1. Overview

The AI Coding Agent Recommendation System is a web application that recommends the best coding agents (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Replit AI, Amazon CodeWhisperer) for a given programming task. Users input a natural language description of their coding task, and the system analyzes the requirements, matches them against a curated knowledge base of coding agents, and recommends the top 3 agents with justifications.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Help developers choose the most suitable AI coding agent for their needs.**
- **Support a wide range of agents and keep the knowledge base up-to-date.**
- **Provide clear, actionable justifications for each recommendation.**
- **Offer a seamless, user-friendly experience.**

---

## 3. User Experience (UX/UI)

### 3.1. User Flow
1. **Landing Page:**
   - Brief description of the system.
   - Input box for natural language task description.
   - Submit button.
2. **Results Page:**
   - Display top 3 recommended coding agents.
   - For each agent: name, logo, score/ranking, justification, and relevant strengths.
   - Option to view more details about each agent.

### 3.2. Frontend Technology
- **Streamlit** for rapid, interactive Python-based web UI.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

---

## 4. Backend Functionality

### 4.1. Agent Knowledge Base
- **Curated data** on each coding agent, including:
  - Name
  - Description/system prompt
  - Supported languages
  - Supported IDEs/platforms
  - Key features/capabilities
  - Strengths/weaknesses
  - Unique selling points
- **Stored as:** JSON or Python dictionary (for MVP)
- **Source:** Official documentation, product pages, and reputable reviews.

### 4.2. Task Analysis Module
- **NLP processing** to extract:
  - Task type (e.g., code generation, bug fix, refactoring)
  - Complexity (simple, moderate, advanced)
  - Requirements (language, framework, IDE, collaboration, etc.)
- **Tech:** spaCy, NLTK, or simple keyword-based logic (for MVP)

### 4.3. Recommendation Engine
- **Scoring algorithm** that:
  - Matches task requirements to agent capabilities
  - Weighs strengths/weaknesses
  - Ranks agents and selects top 3
  - Generates justification for each recommendation

### 4.4. API Layer
- **FastAPI** backend exposes endpoints:
  - `/recommend` (POST): Accepts task description, returns recommendations

```

### 5.2. Data Flow
1. User enters task in Streamlit UI.
2. Streamlit sends POST request to FastAPI `/recommend` endpoint.
3. FastAPI processes the request:
   - Analyzes task
   - Scores and ranks agents
   - Returns top 3 recommendations with justifications
4. Streamlit displays results to user.
